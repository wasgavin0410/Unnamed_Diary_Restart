# Unnamed-Diary-Restart-

  Greeting! This is Kamikaze speaking. This project, known as name " Unnamed Diary", is refereced from Makoto Shinkai's movie, "Your name". One of the scene in the movie, Taki and Mitsuha both using a diary app. That is the main reason about why I wrote this app with my teammates.
  
  Actually, even though this app looks simple and crude, but it cost me lots of time on it. (In fact, the mainly reason why I spent a lot time is, I don't really know how to use Git, lol!) Anyway, if you don't mind it is doesn't deserve same experience as those app shows on the rank of app store, feel free to download this app or reference codes if you need!
